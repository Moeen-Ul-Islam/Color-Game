# Color-Game
This is a fun color guessing game where a random RGB value is generated and based on that, you have to click over the correct color box.
This game has two modes,EASY and HARD.
In easy mode, there are only 3 color boxes among which you have to choose the right one.
In hard mode, there are 6 color boxes among whixh you have to choose correct color.

In this project I have used CSS for designing and JavaScript for the interactivity.
